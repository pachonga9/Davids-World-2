# DavidsWorld
An incredibly ugly land of empty space and obnoxious blur radiuses. 
I decided to combine a few of my practice projects onto one project. 
This will allow me to track my personal progression with programming, styling and collaborative repositories.
I know it's ugly, but it's mine.
You can't take the sky from me.
